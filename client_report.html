                I Soohwan Kim as the lead developer for my site and after I sent him the wireframe and the information for the website he didn't
                do anything for a couple weeks then at some point must have just done it all in one day becausehe had his page done after that and 
                then his Jr devs were able to start doing things ater that.

            <p>
                I didn't have too many problems on my end for the website I got the home page done by the end of the 2nd week of the project. I let 
                my Jr. devs know when I was done with both the html and css for the website, and added the wireframe  and site plan to the Github Page
                right after I got it. Though neither of them have done anything for their pages and I don't know why they haven't gotten around to it.

            <p>
                For this page I had Angelique Legaspi as my lead dev and made the Rubrics page for the website. Angelique was on top of things 
                and had the home page done after the first week so after that I was able to take a look at the wireframe and was able to quickly 
                make the Rubrics page from the site plan on Github.

            <p>
                For this page I had Tyler Massey as my lead dev and I made the gear and tips page. This was a really easy page and Tyler 
                was done with everything on time so I was able to get things done with that page quickly and without any problems.
